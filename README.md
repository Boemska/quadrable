Quadrable is an authenticated database built on top of a sparse binary merkle tree.

## Operation Batching

The Quadrable library is built so that all operations can be batched.

### Batched Updates

Suppose we'd like to update two keys in the DB. You can do this by calling the `put` method two times, like so:

    db.put(txn, "key1", "val1");
    db.put(txn, "key2", "val2");

However, this is not optimal. Each call to `put` must traverse the DB tree to find the location where the updated value should live, and then construct new nodes along the entire path back to the root.

It is more efficient to use the `change()` method, which returns an `UpdateSet`, make the desired changes on this temporary object, and then `apply()` it to the database:

    db.change()
      .put("key1", "val1")
      .put("key2", "val2")
      .apply(txn);

In this case, all the modifications will be made with a single traversal of the tree, and the minimal amount of nodes will be created along the way. Deletions can also be made using the same UpdateSet:

    db.change()
      .del("oldKey")
      .put("newKey", "val")
      .apply(txn);

### Batched Gets

Although the benefit isn't quite as important as batched updates, Quadrable also supports batched gets. This allows us to retrieve multiple values from the DB in a single tree traversal.

So instead of:

    std::string_view key1Val, key2Val;
    bool key1Exists = db.get(txn, "key1", key1Val);
    bool key2Exists = db.get(txn, "key2", key2Val);
    if (key1Exists) std::cout << key1Val;

Use the following to avoid an additional tree traversal:

    auto recs = db.get(txn, { "key1", "key2", });
    if (recs["key1"].exists) std::cout << recs["key1"].val;

**Important**: In both of the above cases, the values are `string_view`s that point into the LMDB memory map. This means that they are valid only up until a write operation is done on the transaction, or the transaction is terminated with commit/abort. If you need to keep them around longer, copy them into a string:

    auto key1ValCopy = std::string(key1Val);
