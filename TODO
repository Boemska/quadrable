  ! tests for diff and mergeProof
  - proof suitable for deletion (uses witnessLeafs instead of witnesses where necessary)
    - WitnessBranch
  - warn when exporting partial tree
  ? ability to compact tree to ensure node Ids are sequential
  ? try putting leaves in their own node key-space to improve locality of interior nodes
  ? maybe way to avoid needing to store stuff in lmdb to validate a proof?
  ? ability to set resource limits on proof sizes when verifying (setMaxProofCmds?)
  ? ability to discard intermediate nodes to save disk-space, since they can be re-computed

  - adversarial proof bloating
    - mine 2 values with common N-bit prefix (can use birthday attacks)
